    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Basic Computer Organization</h2>
        <p>In computer architecture, the organization of a computer system involves the structure and functionality of its components, such as the central processing unit (CPU), memory, and I/O devices. The main goal of computer organization is to execute instructions effectively.</p>
        <p>Basic components of a computer system include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>CPU:</strong> The brain of the computer that executes instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>Memory:</strong> Used to store data and instructions.</li>
            <li><strong>I/O Devices:</strong> Used to communicate with the external environment.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Instructions and Instruction Codes</h2>
        <p>An instruction is a binary code that tells the computer what operation to perform. The instruction code consists of an operation code (opcode) and operands. The opcode specifies the operation, and operands are the data or addresses involved in the operation.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example: 
            Instruction: 10110001
            - Opcode: 1011 (Add)
            - Operand: 0001 (Address)
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Timing and Control / Instruction Cycle</h2>
        <p>The instruction cycle is the sequence of steps a computer follows to fetch and execute an instruction. It consists of:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fetch:</strong> Retrieve the instruction from memory.</li>
            <li><strong>Decode:</strong> Decode the instruction to determine the operation.</li>
            <li><strong>Execute:</strong> Perform the operation as specified by the instruction.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Registers: Types and Functions</h2>
        <p>Registers are small, fast storage locations in the CPU that store data temporarily during execution. The types of registers include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>General Purpose Registers:</strong> Used for temporary data storage during operations.</li>
            <li><strong>Special Purpose Registers:</strong> Used for specific control purposes, such as the Program Counter (PC) and the Accumulator (AC).</li>
            <li><strong>Index Registers:</strong> Used for indexed addressing modes in instruction fetching.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example: 
            Program Counter (PC) - Holds the address of the next instruction to be executed.
            Accumulator (AC) - Holds intermediate results of arithmetic operations.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Register Transfer and Micro-Operations</h2>
        <p>Register transfer is the process of moving data between registers. A micro-operation refers to the smallest operation that can be performed on data in the registers.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            R1 ← R2 (Transfer contents of register R2 to R1)
            R3 ← R1 + R2 (Perform addition and store result in R3)
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Memory and Memory Functions</h2>
        <p>Memory in a computer is used to store instructions and data. The two main types of memory are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Primary Memory:</strong> Volatile memory (RAM), directly accessible by the CPU.</li>
            <li><strong>Secondary Memory:</strong> Non-volatile memory (hard drives, SSDs).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Memory functions include reading data from and writing data to memory.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Bus/Data Transfer Instructions</h2>
        <p>A bus is a collection of parallel lines used for transferring data between various components of a computer. Data transfer instructions are used to move data between registers and memory locations.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            MOV A, B   ; Move data from register B to A
            ADD A, C   ; Add contents of register C to A
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Arithmetic and Logic Micro-Operations</h2>
        <p>Arithmetic micro-operations include basic operations such as addition and subtraction, while logic micro-operations include operations such as AND, OR, and NOT.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            ADD:  R1 ← R1 + R2
            AND:  R1 ← R1 AND R2
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>9. Input/Output and Interrupts</h2>
        <p>Input/Output operations involve communication between the computer and external devices. Interrupts allow devices to send signals to the CPU to indicate an event, prompting the CPU to interrupt its current task and handle the event.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            - Interrupt Request (IRQ) for an I/O device.
            - Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) handles the request.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>10. Memory Reference Instructions</h2>
        <p>Memory reference instructions are used to move data between memory and registers or perform operations on memory data.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            LOAD A, M     ; Load data from memory location M into register A
            STORE A, M    ; Store data from register A into memory location M
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>11. Memory Interfacing and Cache Memory</h2>
        <p>Memory interfacing involves connecting the memory to the CPU using buses. Cache memory is a small, high-speed memory that stores frequently accessed data to speed up processing.</p>
        <p><strong>Cache Memory:</strong> A small but fast memory located between the CPU and RAM. It stores frequently used instructions and data to reduce access time.</p>

        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            PUSH A    ; Push the value of register A onto the stack.
            POP B     ; Pop the top value from the stack and store it in register B.
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Instruction Formats</h2>
        <p>Instruction formats define the layout of bits in an instruction. They typically include fields for the opcode (operation code), operands, and sometimes additional fields for addressing modes or control information.</p>
        <pre class="code-block">
            Example:
            Instruction Format: [Opcode | Operand 1 | Operand 2]
            - Opcode: 0001 (Addition)
            - Operand 1: R1 (First operand)
            - Operand 2: R2 (Second operand)
        </pre>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Addressing Modes</h2>
        <p>Addressing modes define how the operand of an instruction is located in memory. Common addressing modes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Immediate Addressing:</strong> Operand is directly specified in the instruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Addressing:</strong> Operand's memory address is given directly in the instruction.</li>
            <li><strong>Indirect Addressing:</strong> Operand's address is stored in a register or memory location.</li>
            <li><strong>Register Addressing:</strong> Operand is located in a register.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Data Transfer and Manipulation</h2>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Floating Point Arithmetic Operations</h2>
        <p>Floating-point arithmetic operations are used to perform calculations with real numbers. A floating-point number is represented in scientific notation, consisting of a sign bit, exponent, and mantissa. Operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division follow specific algorithms to handle precision and rounding issues.</p>
        <p>IEEE 754 is a widely accepted standard for representing floating-point numbers, which defines formats like single precision (32-bit) and double precision (64-bit).</p>

        <p>Asynchronous data transfer occurs when data is transferred without synchronization between the sender and receiver. The sending device transmits data whenever it’s ready, and the receiving device checks for data at its convenience.</p>
        <p>This can lead to data transfer issues like data loss or overflow, which are mitigated through mechanisms like buffering and error handling protocols.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Modes of Transfer</h2>
        <p>There are several modes of data transfer between the processor and peripheral devices:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Programmed I/O:</strong> The CPU controls the I/O operations, actively polling or waiting for the completion of the transfer.</li>
            <li><strong>Interrupt-Driven I/O:</strong> The peripheral device sends an interrupt to the CPU when it’s ready for data transfer, prompting the CPU to respond.</li>
            <li><strong>Direct Memory Access (DMA):</strong> DMA allows peripherals to transfer data directly to and from memory without CPU intervention, improving efficiency.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Priority Interrupts</h2>
        <p>Interrupts are signals sent by hardware or software to get the CPU’s attention. Priority interrupts are used when multiple devices request CPU attention simultaneously. Devices with higher priority interrupts are serviced first.</p>
        <p>Priority schemes include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fixed Priority:</strong> Devices are assigned fixed priority levels.</li>
            <li><strong>Dynamic Priority:</strong> Priority is assigned dynamically based on certain factors like urgency.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Priority interrupts ensure that critical tasks are handled first, improving the efficiency of multi-device systems.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Direct Memory Access (DMA)</h2>
        <p>DMA is a method used to transfer data directly between a peripheral device and system memory, bypassing the CPU. This improves data transfer efficiency and reduces CPU load.</p>
        <p>The basic steps involved in DMA are:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>The CPU initiates the DMA operation by setting up the DMA controller.</li>
            <li>The peripheral device sends the data directly to the memory, with no CPU intervention.</li>
            <li>The CPU is notified when the transfer is complete and can process the data.</li>
        </ol>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Input/Output Processor (IOP)</h2>
        <p>The I/O Processor (IOP) is a dedicated processor designed to handle I/O operations, offloading work from the main CPU. The IOP manages the communication between the computer system and its peripherals, improving the efficiency of I/O operations.</p>
        <p>Some key functions of the IOP include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Managing data transfer between I/O devices and memory.</li>
            <li>Processing I/O interrupts and coordinating responses.</li>
            <li>Performing error checking and handling during data transfer.</li>
        </ul>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Serial Communication</h2>
        <p>Serial communication refers to the transmission of data one bit at a time over a single communication line. It is commonly used for long-distance communication and requires less hardware than parallel communication.</p>
        <p>Serial communication standards include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>RS-232:</strong> Common standard used for communication between computers and peripherals like modems.</li>
            <li><strong>USB:</strong> Universal Serial Bus is a widely used standard for connecting various devices to computers, such as keyboards, printers, and external storage devices.</li>

<div class="topic-container" id="unit6">
    <h1>UNIT-VI: Assembly Language & Assembly Level Programming</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Assembly Language</h2>
        <p>Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is designed to interact directly with the hardware. It provides a way to write instructions that the microprocessor can understand using human-readable mnemonics. Unlike high-level languages like C or Python, assembly language works closely with the underlying hardware architecture, giving programmers precise control over system resources.</p>
        <p>Assembly language consists of basic instructions and operations that the microprocessor executes. Each instruction in assembly corresponds directly to a machine code instruction.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Assembler</h2>
        <p>An assembler is a software tool that converts assembly language programs into machine code (binary code) that the processor can execute. It translates each assembly instruction into an equivalent machine instruction based on the processor's instruction set architecture (ISA).</p>
        <p>Assemblers can be categorized into:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Single-pass assembler:</strong> Translates the source code in one pass.</li>
            <li><strong>Multi-pass assembler:</strong> Requires multiple passes to generate the machine code, allowing it to resolve undefined labels and references.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In addition to converting assembly code to machine code, assemblers can perform optimizations such as removing redundant instructions and improving performance.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Assembly Level Instructions</h2>
        <p>Assembly level instructions are the commands in assembly language that correspond directly to machine operations. These instructions operate on registers, memory, and the arithmetic logic unit (ALU). Common types of assembly instructions include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Data Transfer Instructions:</strong> These instructions move data between registers or between memory and registers. Example: <div class="code-block">MOV A, B</div> (move data from register B to A).</li>
            <li><strong>Arithmetic Instructions:</strong> These instructions perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Example: <div class="code-block">ADD A, B</div> (add the value of B to A).</li>
            <li><strong>Logical Instructions:</strong> These instructions perform logical operations like AND, OR, and NOT. Example: <div class="code-block">AND A, B</div> (perform logical AND between A and B).</li>
            <li><strong>Control Flow Instructions:</strong> These instructions alter the flow of control in a program, such as branching or jumping. Example: <div class="code-block">JMP address</div> (jump to the specified address).</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Macros</h2>
        <p>A macro is a sequence of instructions that can be defined and reused in assembly programs. Macros help in reducing the length of the program, improving code readability, and making maintenance easier. Instead of writing the same instructions repeatedly, a macro is defined once and invoked multiple times.</p>
        <p>Macros are typically used to encapsulate frequently used code segments, such as loops or arithmetic operations. They are expanded at assembly time into the actual machine instructions.</p>
        <p>Example of defining a macro:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
        MACRO ADDITION
            ADD A, B
            MOV C, A
        ENDM
        </div>
        <p>In this example, the macro <div class="code-block">ADDITION</div> adds the values in registers A and B and stores the result in register C. The macro can be invoked anywhere in the program by simply writing <div class="code-block">ADDITION</div>.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Use of Macros in I/O Instructions</h2>
        <p>Macros can be especially useful in handling I/O instructions. For example, when performing I/O operations such as reading from or writing to a port, macros can abstract the details of the operation, making the program easier to read and maintain.</p>
        <p>Example macro for reading from an input port:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
        MACRO READ_PORT
            IN 0x00      ; Read from port 0x00
            MOV A, L     ; Store the value in register L
        ENDM
        </div>
        <p>This macro reads from a specified port address and stores the result in register L. The macro can be reused throughout the program whenever this operation is required.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Program Loops</h2>
        <p>Loops are essential for repetitive tasks in assembly language. A loop allows a set of instructions to be executed repeatedly until a specific condition is met. Commonly used loop structures include <div class="code-block">FOR</div>, <div class="code-block">WHILE</div>, and <div class="code-block">DO-WHILE</div>.</p>
        <p>Example of a simple loop in assembly language that adds numbers:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
        MOV CX, 10     ; Set the loop counter to 10
        MOV AX, 0      ; Clear AX register to accumulate sum
    LOOP_START:
        ADD AX, BX     ; Add BX to AX
        DEC CX         ; Decrement loop counter
        JNZ LOOP_START ; Jump if CX is not zero
        </div>
        <p>In this example, the loop will execute 10 times, adding the value in register BX to AX, and the loop counter (CX) is decremented each time.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Programming Arithmetic and Logic Subroutines</h2>
        <p>Subroutines are reusable blocks of code that perform specific tasks, such as arithmetic or logical operations. Subroutines allow for better code organization and reusability.</p>
        <p>Example of an addition subroutine:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
        ADDITION_SUBROUTINE:
            ADD A, B     ; Add A and B
            RET          ; Return from the subroutine
        </div>
        <p>This subroutine adds the values of registers A and B and then returns to the calling point.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Input/Output Programming</h2>
        <p>In assembly language, input/output programming is essential for interacting with external devices like keyboards, monitors, and sensors. I/O instructions allow a program to read data from input devices or send data to output devices.</p>
        <p>Example of reading input from the keyboard and printing it to the screen:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
        MOV AH, 1        ; BIOS function to read a character from the keyboard
        INT 21h          ; Interrupt to execute the function
        MOV DL, AL       ; Move the character to DL for display
        MOV AH, 2        ; BIOS function to display a character
        INT 21h          ; Interrupt to execute the function
        </div>
        <p>This example demonstrates how to use the BIOS interrupt <div class="code-block">INT 21h</div> to read a character from the keyboard and display it on the screen.</p>
