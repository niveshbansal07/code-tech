    <h1>UNIT-IV: Virtualization</h1>

    <!-- Section: Introduction to Virtualization -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Introduction to Virtualization</h2>
        <p>Virtualization is the process of creating a virtual version of a resource, such as a server, storage device, or network, which allows multiple workloads to run independently on the same physical hardware. It plays a key role in cloud computing by enabling the efficient use of resources.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Types of Virtualization -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Types of Virtualization</h2>

        <h3>Full Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Full virtualization involves creating a virtual environment where the guest operating system is unaware that it is running in a virtualized environment. This allows for complete isolation between the host and the guest OS.</p>

        <h3>Para virtualization</h3>
        <p>Para virtualization involves modifying the guest operating system to be aware of the virtualized environment. This improves performance as the guest OS interacts with the hypervisor directly to improve resource allocation.</p>

        <h3>Hardware-Assisted Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Hardware-assisted virtualization leverages the capabilities of modern processors to enable more efficient and secure virtual environments. This includes using CPU features like Intel VT-x or AMD-V to facilitate virtualization directly at the hardware level.</p>

        <h3>Hypervisor</h3>
        <p>A hypervisor is a software layer that enables the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs). It controls the hardware resources and allocates them to the virtualized environments.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Section: Virtualization Techniques -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Virtualization Techniques</h2>

        <h3>OS Virtualization</h3>
        <p>OS virtualization allows multiple instances of the same operating system to run on a single machine. It provides isolation at the OS level and is used in containerization technologies like Docker.</p>

        <h3>Server Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Server virtualization enables the creation of multiple virtual servers on a single physical server, allowing for better resource utilization and flexibility in managing workloads.</p>

        <h3>Memory Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Memory virtualization allows physical memory resources to be divided and allocated to different virtual machines. It enables more efficient memory management in virtual environments, optimizing the use of available RAM.</p>

        <h3>Storage Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Storage virtualization aggregates multiple storage devices into a single virtual storage pool, which makes managing data more efficient and improves flexibility in data storage and access.</p>

        <h3>Network Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Network virtualization involves abstracting network resources to create virtual networks that are independent of the underlying physical network. This improves scalability, flexibility, and security in the cloud environment.</p>

        <h3>Application Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Application virtualization allows applications to run on different machines without needing to be installed locally. The application operates in a container and is delivered over the network as a virtual instance.</p>

        <h3>Processor Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Processor virtualization involves isolating CPU resources and allocating them to different virtual machines. This allows the creation of multiple VMs with isolated processing power.</p>

        <h3>Data Virtualization</h3>
        <p>Data virtualization allows data from different sources to be accessed and manipulated without needing to know the exact details of the underlying storage systems. It provides a unified view of data from multiple sources.</p>

    <!-- Section: Hypervisors -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Hypervisors</h2>
        <p>A hypervisor is crucial in virtualization as it manages the virtual machines, allowing them to run on a physical host. There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 and Type 2.</p>

        <h3>Types of Hypervisors</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Type 1 Hypervisor:</strong> Also known as a "bare-metal" hypervisor, it runs directly on the hostâ€™s hardware, providing high performance and efficiency. Examples include VMware ESXi and Microsoft Hyper-V.</li>
            <li><strong>Type 2 Hypervisor:</strong> Runs on top of a host operating system, providing easier setup but with lower performance compared to Type 1. Examples include VMware Workstation and Oracle VirtualBox.</li>
        </ul>
