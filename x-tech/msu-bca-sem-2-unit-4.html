                principles of management. He is known for his administrative theory, which is based on 14 principles of
                management:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Division of Work:</strong> Specialization increases output by making employees more
                    efficient.</li>
                <li><strong>Authority and Responsibility:</strong> Managers must have the authority to give orders and
                    the responsibility to ensure work is completed.</li>
                <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> Employees must respect rules and agreements to ensure smooth
                    operations.</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Command:</strong> Each employee should receive orders from one superior only.</li>
                <li><strong>Unity of Direction:</strong> Activities with similar objectives should be grouped together
                    under one plan and directed by one person.</li>
                <li><strong>Subordination of Individual Interests to General Interest:</strong> The interest of the
                    organization should take precedence over individual interests.</li>
                <li><strong>Remuneration:</strong> Compensation should be fair and provide motivation for workers to do
                    their best.</li>
                <li><strong>Centralization:</strong> The degree of centralization depends on the size and nature of the
                    organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalar Chain:</strong> A clear chain of command must exist within the organization.</li>
                <li><strong>Order:</strong> There should be an orderly arrangement of people and materials in the
                    workplace.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Fairness should prevail in treatment of employees.</li>
                <li><strong>Stability of Tenure of Personnel:</strong> High employee turnover is detrimental to an
                    organization’s efficiency.</li>
                <li><strong>Initiative:</strong> Employees should be encouraged to take initiative and contribute to the
