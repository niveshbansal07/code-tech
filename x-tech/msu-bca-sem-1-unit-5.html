          <p>There are several techniques that enhance the effectiveness of written communication:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Active Voice:</strong> Use active voice where the subject performs the action (e.g., "The manager approved the proposal" instead of "The proposal was approved by the manager").</li>
            <li><strong>Short Sentences:</strong> Keep sentences short and to the point to make the message easier to digest.</li>
            <li><strong>Use of Bullet Points and Lists:</strong> Lists make the information clearer and easier to scan, especially in business documents.</li>
            <li><strong>Headings and Subheadings:</strong> Use headings and subheadings to organize your content and make it easier for the reader to navigate.</li>
            <li><strong>Proofreading:</strong> Always proofread your writing before sending it out. This helps eliminate errors and improves the quality of your document.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Example:</strong> A project update report should use short, clear sentences, bullet points for key updates, and proper headings to divide sections like “Progress,” “Challenges,” and “Next Steps.”</p>

          <ul>

            <li><strong>Revising:</strong> Review your draft for clarity, structure, and content. Make sure it aligns with the purpose of the communication.</li>
            <li><strong>Editing:</strong> Correct grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes. Ensure that the writing flows logically and is free of errors.</li>
            <li><strong>Finalizing:</strong> Double-check your document before sending it. Ensure that it meets the communication goals and is ready for distribution.</li>
