            <h2>1. Review of Fundamentals</h2>
            <p>A <strong>matrix</strong> is a rectangular arrangement of numbers in rows and columns. It is used to
                represent data or systems of linear equations. The size of a matrix is defined as m × n, where m is
                the
                number of rows and n is the number of columns.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ] is a 2×2 matrix.
            </pre>

        <section class="section">
            <h2>2. Equivalent Matrices</h2>
            <p>Two matrices are <strong>equivalent</strong> if one can be obtained from the other by a sequence of
                elementary row or column operations.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]
    B = [ [1, 2], [0, -2] ] (obtained by replacing second row with R2 - 3×R1)
            </pre>

            <h2>3. Elementary Row (Column) Operations</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Row switching: Swap two rows.</li>
                <li>Row multiplication: Multiply a row by a nonzero scalar.</li>
                <li>Row addition: Replace a row with the sum of itself and a scalar multiple of another row.</li>
            </ul>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    Original: [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]

            <h2>4. Rank of a Matrix (Normal Form)</h2>
            <p>The <strong>rank</strong> of a matrix is the maximum number of linearly independent rows or columns.
                By
                reducing a matrix to its <strong>normal form</strong> (also known as row-reduced form), we can find
                its
                rank.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = [ [1, 2], [3, 4] ]
    Reduce to normal form:
    → [ [1, 2], [0, -2] ] → [ [1, 2], [0, 1] ]

        <section class="section">
            <h2>5. Rank of a Matrix (Echelon Form)</h2>
            <p>A matrix is in <strong>echelon form</strong> if all nonzero rows are above any rows of all zeros, and
                the
                leading entry of each nonzero row is to the right of the leading entry of the row above it. The
                number
                of non-zero rows gives the rank.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:
    A = [ [1, 2, -1], [2, 4, 3], [1, 1, 1] ]
    → Row reduce to echelon form
    → [ [1, 2, -1], [0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0] ]

            <p>To detect if a graph is planar, algorithms like <strong>Kuratowski's Algorithm</strong> or

            <pre class="matrix">
            V - E + F = 2

            <p><strong>Example:</strong> For the planar graph above, if we have 4 vertices, 4 edges, and 1 face (the
                outer region), we get:</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
            4 - 4 + 1 = 2

            <p>A <strong>directed graph</strong> or <strong>digraph</strong> is a graph in which edges have a
                direction.
                That means an edge connects one vertex to another in a specific direction. These directed edges are
                often represented by arrows.</p>
            <pre class="matrix">
    Example:

                    and
                    no multiple edges.</li>
