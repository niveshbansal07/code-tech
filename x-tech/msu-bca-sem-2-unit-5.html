    <h1>UNIT-I: Basic Concepts of Accounting, Financial Statements, Financial Statement Analysis, Cost Centre, Basic Concepts of Inventory, Tally Configuration & INI Setup</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Basic Concepts of Accounting</h2>
        <p>Accounting is the process of recording, summarizing, and reporting financial transactions to provide insights into a business's financial performance and position. Key concepts include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Assets:</strong> Resources owned by a business, e.g., cash, buildings, machinery.</li>
            <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> Obligations the business must fulfill, e.g., loans, payables.</li>
            <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Owner's claim on the assets, calculated as assets - liabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Revenue:</strong> Income from sales of goods or services.</li>
            <li><strong>Expenses:</strong> Costs incurred in running the business.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A company sells products worth $1000 and incurs expenses of $600. The profit is calculated as:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Profit = Revenue - Expenses <br>
            Profit = $1000 - $600 = $400
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Financial Statements</h2>
        <p>Financial statements summarize the financial activities of a company. The key statements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Income Statement:</strong> Shows the company's profitability over a period, highlighting revenues and expenses.</li>
            <li><strong>Balance Sheet:</strong> Displays the company's financial position at a point in time, showing assets, liabilities, and equity.</li>
            <li><strong>Cash Flow Statement:</strong> Indicates the inflows and outflows of cash, showing how cash is being used.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The income statement of a company for the year might show $50,000 in revenue and $30,000 in expenses. The net income is:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Net Income = Revenue - Expenses <br>
            Net Income = $50,000 - $30,000 = $20,000
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>3. Financial Statement Analysis</h2>
        <p>Financial statement analysis involves evaluating the performance and financial health of a company through its financial statements. Key tools include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Ratios:</strong> Financial ratios such as liquidity ratios, profitability ratios, and solvency ratios are used to evaluate the company's performance.</li>
            <li><strong>Trend Analysis:</strong> Analyzing financial statements over multiple periods to identify trends.</li>
            <li><strong>Common-size Statements:</strong> Converting financial data into percentages for better comparison across companies.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> The current ratio is calculated as:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Current Ratio = Current Assets / Current Liabilities <br>
            Current Assets = $50,000, Current Liabilities = $20,000 <br>
            Current Ratio = $50,000 / $20,000 = 2.5
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Cost Centre</h2>
        <p>A cost centre is a department or unit within an organization where costs are incurred, but it does not generate revenue. Its primary goal is cost control and monitoring.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Example:</strong> A production department in a factory might be a cost centre, with costs for labor, materials, and overheads being tracked.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example of Cost Centre:</strong> If a factory's production department spends $10,000 on labor and $5,000 on materials, the total cost for that department is:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Total Cost = Labor + Materials <br>
            Total Cost = $10,000 + $5,000 = $15,000
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Basic Concepts of Inventory</h2>
        <p>Inventory refers to the goods and materials held by a business for resale or production. Basic inventory types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Raw Materials:</strong> Materials used in manufacturing products.</li>
            <li><strong>Work-in-Progress:</strong> Products that are in the process of being manufactured.</li>
            <li><strong>Finished Goods:</strong> Products that are completed and ready for sale.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> A company may hold:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            Raw Materials = $10,000 <br>
            Work-in-Progress = $5,000 <br>
            Finished Goods = $15,000
        </div>
        <p>Total Inventory = Raw Materials + Work-in-Progress + Finished Goods = $10,000 + $5,000 + $15,000 = $30,000</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Tally Configuration & INI Setup</h2>
        <p>Tally is an accounting software that allows businesses to manage financial data efficiently. The configuration of Tally involves setting up various features and options such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>INI Setup:</strong> Configuration files that determine Tally's settings and functionalities.</li>
            <li><strong>Data Directory:</strong> The folder where Tally stores data files, reports, and configurations.</li>
            <li><strong>Single & Multiple Users:</strong> Configuring Tally for use by one or more users.</li>
            <li><strong>Company Configuration:</strong> Creating and configuring company details such as name, address, financial year, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> In Tally, you can set the financial year to start from April 1 and the currency symbol to ₹. You can also configure whether the company uses GST or not.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Tally Screen Components</h2>
        <p>The Tally screen consists of various components that facilitate the smooth operation of the software. These include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Gateway of Tally:</strong> The main screen that provides access to various features like accounts, inventory, and reports.</li>

    <h1>UNIT-II: Create, Alter & Display Groups and Ledgers, All Accounting Voucher Types and Transactions</h1>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>1. Create, Alter & Display Groups and Ledgers</h2>
        <p>In Tally, groups and ledgers are essential for classifying transactions. Groups classify similar ledgers, and each ledger represents an account.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Create Group:</strong> A group is created by selecting a predefined category such as 'Assets,' 'Liabilities,' etc., and entering the group name.</li>
            <li><strong>Create Ledger:</strong> A ledger is created within a group, representing individual accounts like 'Cash,' 'Sales,' or 'Purchases.'</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> To create a new ledger in the 'Assets' group for 'Bank Account', follow these steps:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            1. Go to "Accounting Vouchers" <br>
            2. Select "Create Ledger" <br>
            3. Choose "Assets" as the Group <br>
            4. Enter "Bank Account" as the Ledger Name
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. All Accounting Voucher Types and Transactions</h2>
        <p>Tally provides various types of accounting vouchers for different types of transactions. Some common voucher types include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Receipt Voucher:</strong> Used for recording cash or bank receipts.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Voucher:</strong> Used for recording cash or bank payments.</li>
            <li><strong>Sales Voucher:</strong> Used for recording sales transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Purchase Voucher:</strong> Used for recording purchase transactions.</li>
            <li><strong>Journal Voucher:</strong> Used for non-cash transactions like adjusting accounts.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> To record a receipt transaction for Rs. 5000, use the following steps:</p>

        <h2>4. Item and Account Invoice Transactions</h2>
        <p>Tally allows the entry of both item invoices (inventory-related) and account invoices (non-inventory transactions). The difference is that item invoices track stock, while account invoices do not.</p>

        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">

    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>7. Transactions Using Bill-wise Details</h2>
        <p>Bill-wise details are used to manage outstanding bills and their payments. This feature allows tracking of due amounts and payments for a particular bill.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> To record a bill payment using bill-wise details:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            1. Go to "Accounting Vouchers" <br>
            2. Select "Payment" Voucher Type <br>
            3. Choose the "Bill-wise Details" option <br>
            4. Enter the bill number, due date, and amount paid
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>8. Create, Alter & Display Cost Centre and Cost Categories</h2>
        <p>Cost Centres and Cost Categories help in tracking and allocating expenses to specific departments or projects. Cost centres represent individual units, while cost categories represent different types of costs.</p>

        <div class="code-block">
            1. Go to "Accounting Info" <br>
            2. Select "Cost Centres" > "Create" <br>
            3. Name it "Production Department" <br>
            4. Enter the relevant details

    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>9. Cost Centre & Cost Category Allocation in Voucher Entry</h2>
        <p>Once cost centres and cost categories are created, they can be assigned to relevant voucher entries to track specific expenses.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> During a payment voucher entry, you can allocate the cost to the "Production Department" cost centre.</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            1. Go to "Accounting Vouchers" <br>
            2. Select "Payment" Voucher Type <br>
            3. Enter the voucher details <br>
            4. Allocate the cost to the relevant cost centre

    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>10. Creating Cost Centre Class and Invoice Entry in a Class Situation</h2>
        <p>A Cost Centre Class is used when you want to group similar cost centres under a common class. This can simplify cost reporting.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> To create a Cost Centre Class:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            1. Go to "Accounting Info" <br>
            2. Select "Cost Centre Class" > "Create" <br>
            3. Enter the class name, such as "Departmental Costs" <br>
            4. Assign relevant cost centres to the class
        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>11. Create, Alter & Delete Foreign Currencies</h2>
        <p>Tally supports transactions in foreign currencies. You can create, alter, or delete foreign currencies used in your transactions.</p>

        </div>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>12. Voucher Entry Using Foreign Currency</h2>
        <p>When recording transactions in foreign currencies, Tally automatically converts them into the base currency based on the exchange rate.</p>
        <p><strong>Example:</strong> To enter a sales voucher using USD as the foreign currency:</p>
        <div class="code-block">
            1. Go to "Accounting Vouchers" <br>
            2. Select "Sales" Voucher Type <br>
