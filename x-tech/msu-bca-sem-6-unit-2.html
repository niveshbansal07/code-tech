            <li>Examples: Rational Rose, Enterprise Architect, StarUML.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Types of CASE Tools:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Upper CASE Tools:</strong> Support early SDLC phases like requirements and design (e.g., DFD, ERD tools).</li>
            <li><strong>Lower CASE Tools:</strong> Support implementation and testing (e.g., code generators, debuggers).</li>
            <li><strong>Integrated CASE Tools:</strong> Provide end-to-end support for the entire development cycle.</li>

        <h2>1. Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD)</h2>
        <p>OOAD is a methodology that uses object modeling to analyze and design systems based on real-world entities.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Emphasizes modularity, reusability, and encapsulation.</li>
            <li>Aligns system design closely with real-world problems.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>2. Object Modeling Technique (OMT)</h2>
        <p>OMT is used to represent system components as objects with attributes and behaviors.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Describes "what" the system contains using object diagrams.</li>
            <li>Identifies key objects and their relationships.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="code-block">
            <pre>
Example:
Class: Car
Attributes: model, color, engine_type
Methods: start(), stop(), accelerate()

        <h2>3. Dynamic Modeling</h2>
        <p>Describes the behavior of objects over time, focusing on object interactions and states.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Includes state diagrams and sequence diagrams.</li>
            <li>Helps model system logic and flow of control.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>4. Functional Object-Oriented Design</h2>
        <p>This step focuses on translating object models into implementable functional components.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Designs how objects interact to perform system operations.</li>
            <li>Defines method functionalities and class hierarchies.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>5. Object-Oriented Programming Systems (OOPS)</h2>
        <p>OOPS implements designs through object-oriented programming languages like Java, C++, or Python.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Uses classes and objects for implementation.</li>
            <li>Supports concepts like inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
        <h2>6. Object-Oriented Databases</h2>
        <p>These databases store data as objects rather than tables.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ideal for applications with complex data types.</li>
            <li>Examples: db4o, ObjectDB, Versant.</li>
